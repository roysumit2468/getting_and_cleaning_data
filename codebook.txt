The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern after Averaging for each signals:  



Coloumns									Description
subject_id									Identifies which subject(person) was experimented upon
activity									Identifies the activity of the subject

All the other coloumns names can be divided into 4 parts.
For e.g     Avg-tBodyAcc-mean()-X
	1)Avg-t,	2)BodyAcc,	3)mean(),	4)X
	
	1)Avg-t represents average value of the variable in time domain subject and activity wise.
	  similarly,Avg-f represents average value of the variable in frequency domain subject and activity wise.
	
	2)BodyAcc is a feature which is tested in experimented.
	  Other features are 
						GravityAcc
						BodyAccJerk
						BodyGyro
						BodyGyroJerk
						BodyAccMag
						GravityAccMag
						BodyAccJerkMag
						BodyGyroMag
						BodyGyroJerkMag
						BodyAcc
						BodyAccJerk
						BodyGyro
						BodyAccMag
						BodyAccJerkMag
						BodyGyroMag
					    BodyGyroJerkMag
	
	3)mean() represents average value of the feature.
	 similarly std() represents  standard deviation of the feature
	
	4)X is the direction along which measurement is done
	  similarly Y,Z are also the respective directions.
